To save the results in reversed alphabetical orer in each output file, I configured my job to use a custom class called MyText. The class implements Writable and WritableComparable<MyText>. This allows me to override the compare to method, controlling the order of the outputs. My "compareTo" function takes another MyText object to compare to, if the text is the same, 0 is returned. If the other text is less than the current object, 1 will return. Else, -1 is returned. These return values are the invers of the implementation of the hadoop text class, which sorts in alphabetical order. Since we want the inverse, I can simply multiply the Text compareTo function call result by negative one and get the desired arrangement. From here, the hadoop librry will handle the rest of the job. The only things I had to change in WordSort.java was the generic key output type of the TokenizerMapper class, the generic key input type of the IntSumReducer class, and the generic key output type of IntSumReducer. Finally, I had to set the setOutputKeyClass to MyText.class.
